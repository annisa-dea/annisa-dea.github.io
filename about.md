<p>Hi! I'm Annisa, and I am an incoming first-year PhD student in the Cell and Molecular Biology program at the University of Chicago. I am broadly interested in combining methods of classical molecular biology and genetics with modern, high-throughput processes to elucidate uncovered molecular provesses. Previously, I worked as a research assistant with Dr. Elizabeth Hong at Caltech to investigate the mechanisms of neuronal wiring of the <i>Drosophila</i> olfactory circuit. I graduated from Harvey Mudd College in 2017 with a degree in Biology and Chemistry, where I looked at the molecular mechanisms of aging in fruit flies.</p>

<p>Outside the lab, I enjoy going hiking, rock climbing, swing-dancing, and board games. </p>
